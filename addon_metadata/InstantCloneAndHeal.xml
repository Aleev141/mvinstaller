<![CDATA[
This addon makes cloning instant and instantly heals your crew if you have a powered medbay or crew/drone that can heal other crew when you're not in a battle. However, you also won't have instant cloning or healing if the oxygen is broken, there's a fire, or for the instant healing, a breached system. It also takes into account health requirements for abilities, so it won't heal your crew if your Shell Scientist is too damaged after a battle. Finally, only anaerobic crew will be instantly healed in ships with no oxygen system unless they have healing that can counteract suffocation.

		Suggestions for the description...

		Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship, how
		does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

		Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

		Optionally list important features.

		List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or requirements.

		Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.

			Stealth-A, Rock-A,    Slug-A,    Mantis-A,
			Lanius-A,  Crystal-A

		Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
		that again for each new version.
