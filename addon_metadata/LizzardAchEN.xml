This mod adds achievements to all page 1 MV cruisers.

Created for the 2024 achievement contest.

Special thanks to:
Arc for making the balboni sprites
Gabriel for helping me with Lua
Chrono for calling the conscription officers on me

		Suggestions for the description...

		Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship, how
		does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

		Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

		Optionally list important features.

		List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or requirements.

		Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
			Kestrel-A, Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Zoltan-A,
			Stealth-A, Rock-A,    Slug-A,    Mantis-A,
			Lanius-A,  Crystal-A

		Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
		that again for each new version.
